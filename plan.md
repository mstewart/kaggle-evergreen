StumbleUpon Kaggle Challenge 
=========================


# Init

1. Look at the distributions of each parameters in the training set (each 
   parameter for which deriving the distribution makes sense). Extract
   attributes that might be in a compound view in the current training
   data: eg {http://domain/uri/}  => {domain} | {uri}
2. Do PCA
3. Use SVM and Rpart to derive a preliminary model. 
4. Evalute SVM on training set. 


# Raw data 

1. Simply convert into plain text 
2. Look at word frequency
3. Is there any relation between word frequency and label.
